 AUTOMATIC ALCOHOL DETECTION SYSTEM Using Alcohol detection sensor which is the part of Internet Of Things
 This project introduces a sophisticated, integrated system designed to detect alcohol levels 
in the breath of a driver before allowing vehicle operation. Using a reliable ethanol gas sensor, 
the system evaluates the alcohol concentration in the driver's breath when they attempt to start 
the vehicle. If the alcohol content exceeds a set legal limit, the system intervenes by disabling 
the vehicle's ignition, thereby preventing the driver from operating the car while under the 
influence.
